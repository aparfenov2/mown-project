#=======================GLOBAL COST MAP PARAMETERS==============================
# A costmap is a means to figure out the cost to get to a destination (like
# routing algorithms in networking). These parameters are exclusively for the 
# global cost map. The purpose of the global costmap is to create long-term plans 
# over the entire environment. For info on these parameters consult section 2.3.2 
# on this page: https://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: this yaml file only gets loaded if we are running move_base with a map! 
# This is the default that I rely on now (May 11/ 2020). The decision which
# yaml file to load is made in the launch file. 
#===============================================================================

#The "global_frame" parameter defines what coordinate frame the costmap should 
#run in.
global_frame: map
rolling_window: false
track_unknown_space: true
update_frequency: 4.0
publish_frequency: 3.0
transform_tolerance: 0.5
