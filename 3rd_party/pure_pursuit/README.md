## Pure Pursuit Controller For ROS Navigation 
This is the first of a series of robotic controllers for using with ROS. This repository contains a very simple version of a pure pursuit controller implemented as a plug-in for the ROS Navigaion stack.
Moreover, the code is based on the carrot planner (http://wiki.ros.org/carrot_planner), so its usage is very alike.
